Combining theories of the public sphere with quantum physics, they investigate the potentialities of the story – seen as virtual matter and a precise political tool. This emerges from the presumption of an unstable narrative field, in which they examine unexpected couplings and clashes between narrative particles. The Idle Institute’s projects build from narrative experiments: poetic traps in urban space, phone pranks, impersonation games and sci-fi installations. Currently developing a theory of the narratology of the public sphere, their research explores narrative entanglement, machine(s) of writing and technologies of storytelling.

        <p>Bartholomew’s grandparents had been nest builders. These treacherous abodes had been the birthplace of his parents, his aunts, his uncles, his cousins. His grandparents had always taken pride in their sourcing of the best materials native to the stormy peninsula they had resided on for generations. Back then, the family would share the task of repairing the nest. The males, coming back from sea, would bring an assortment of bracken, herbaceous stems and twigs and the females would weave them into wafts and wefts that respired in the wind.</p>
        <p>The grandparent’s however, with a large family to feed and a parsimonious nature, were always on the look out for new technologies. They would keep a keen eye on the movements of the townsfolk—their numerous stone building projects and endless hunting markets—for they had a hunch that these folk, in their ignorance, would forget the simple tasks of survival.</p>
        <p>Some of the nesters would regale stories of how the townsfolk, many years ago, had in fact preyed on the nesters themselves! They had been so desperate to hunt, that the clever ones had fabricated nets on their roofs to catch them, while other unfed folk would literally jump on them in the middle of the day and try to sink their teeth into their crisp white plumage. But such stories would always end in guttural hoards of laughter, as it was said that when the folk bit into them, they would wretch and vomit, as the nesters meat was far too bitter for the townsfolk.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in the ensuing years, the townsfolk’s delicate tastes had become oversaturated and abundant. Bartholomews grandparents had watched the sea-folk’s habits change, as they relied on their dilapidated rusty boats less and less. There had been days when the nesters would follow the boats into the bay, as a colonial herd, shitting on them until they threw back the chum and surplus. But now they fetched only small catches of scallops and deep sea bass, which they shared with the slow and hobbling land-folk in the colourful showrooms on the seafront. </p>
        <p>Once, perturbed by such a change, Barts grandfather had followed one of the sea-folk to his large house on the hill and had landed on the windowsill. Standing perpendicular to the window he had observed the man reclined, absently watching a wooden box with a talking red bodied woman in it. All the while he tongued then ate an elongated brown finger which crumbled into stones on the sea-folks bunched belly. A strange brown mud stretched between his lips and the finger when he moved his hand away, getting thinner and thinner until it broke into the trails of a thousand tiny snails amongst the stones. Barts grandfather was transfixed, cocking his head sideways rhythmically to maximise his perspective. The most amazing thing was after the brown finger been broken into its new places, the man held a black and red sheath that had protected it from his hands, then scrunched it and threw it on the floor. The sheath held its shape, bent around in an angular knot, jagged and harsh.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">“It’s not about breathability Magda” he spat, “its about safety, protection, sustainability!”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“But Jet’! I will not tolerate such ignorance, the plastics industry will ruin us.”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Plastic’s industry! What are you talking about? These are new materials that the townsfolk use to protect their food, they are more clever than us. We will be able to build the longest lasting, safest nests. They will protect our children for generations.”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Bu-“</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Magda!… my love, have you not always wanted a home?”</p>
        <p>And it was so. The nesters set upon frantically sourcing wrappers, which they found most often at the back of the colourful storefronts and dustbins. The exuberant sheaths of all shapes and sizes served as lightweight and resourceful nests for the young to dwell. Often made of thin aluminium and polystyrene, these nests were scrunched together to form spiny shells, often stained with the moulding food remnants. The townsfolk began to notice these strange alien constructions on their roofs and on the coastal paths. With such bizarre moulds of junk dotted like small dystopian hamlets, superstition brewed and before long it was said that someone was building nests for the birds and the town plunged into a gargantuan garbage witch hunt. </p>
        <p>In the catatonic frenzy, the nesters succumbed to the pressure of this insurrection, and the 6 years of chaos commenced. Many families left for distant shores in search of a more traditional colony; others began to drop nests on the townsfolk, in an attempt to prove that no alien force was the perpetrator of such madness, but in doing so ostracised themselves from both the nesting and town communities. These desperate birds found their sticky end from the bullets of air-rifles or starvation. </p>
        <p>In times of miscommunication and chaos, the gulls embraced the frivolity of such insecurity, and begun one of the most frenzied mating seasons in recent history. The men, drunk on their confusion and high on sugar, sought out company in as many of the brittle nests as they could. Above the cliffs, amongst the dilated white and grey stucco painting of their collective presence, the men would sing:</p>
        <div class="poem">
          <p>Kumbaya, my doting Lord</p>
          <p>We who have no maker,</p>
          <p>Don’t dive down for fancy fish,</p>
          <p>We ain’t no bleedin’ hakers!</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Kumbaya, watch me dive</p>
          <p>to a bed i’ll sleep in later,</p>
          <p>I’ll hunt the bins for chocolate rings</p>
          <p>And make friends with her cloaca!</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Kumbaya, my doting Lord,</p>
          <p>Come help find pearls for mother,</p>
          <p>And if she’s down with Billy-bob,</p>
          <p>We’ll gift them to my lover!</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Da da daa, da-daa da daa</p>
          <p>Da da da da daa-da….</p>
        </div>
        <p>Bartholomew was laid during the 5th year of this insurrection. His mother and father had taken over the family nest, now positioned on the fringes of the nesting community. His first encounter with the world had been the red and yellow-outlined words ‘Time Out’.</p>
        <p>His mother and father had met before the age of chaos, and had chosen to respect the family tradition, in doing so inheriting the nest from Barts grandparents. They were kind yet stern, not keen to indulge in the bustle of the other nesters madness. They hunted on weekdays, taking it in turns to pluck fish in the harbour. And on the weekends and special occasions, Barts father would hunt the bins at the hunting market to bring home something sweet. </p>
        <p>They were very proud of Bartholomew. He was pensive, always showed a willingness to work hard and kept his plumage slick and clean. During his first winter, he was complemented by many mothers in the community for his generosity to the community. He always found time to help another and drop fish into other’s nest if the family had some to spare. Many cited Bart’s family as the stalwarts of the age of chaos, working tightly behind the scenes and keeping an open mind. They upheld their parent’s values of hard-work, labour and safety.</p>
        <p>But by Bart’s second winter plumage, it was becoming clear that the colony was entering a new age. He would watch the other teens in their nests, those who in his eyes did little for the surrounding nesters, still take food from their parents and reduce them to howls of laughter over sugar induced escapades in the town. “What a nightmare!” they would howl, “you really are a piece of work.” But as Bart would stare on, these young cads would be embraced with a stirring pride by their parents, and sheltered beneath a their fathers outstretched wing. </p>
        <p>Bart would often take short flights in moments of quiet, muttering ‘Time Out’ under his breath. He would soar to the bronze statue of a sea-folk on the shoreline and perch on top of its hatted and moustached head. He noticed that as the day burned into night, the spotlight that lit the statue from beneath couldn’t penetrate the skin of the statue. From this appeared a crisp triangle of darkness, that would stretch into the sky: a place where light would never touch, where nothing could be seen. He’d stare into it, wondering if this was what ‘Time Out’ meant: a place behind the light. Such fear it aroused in him, he wondered if the other nesters had discovered this hollow.</p>
        <p>One evening, after perching for some time, Bartholomew returned to the nest, to find a new wrapper threaded into the nest mesh. Upon a purple background was set a picture of a snow-birds who came from the north, who Bart’s mother had told him stories as a chick. But the bird was performing the strangest action: with two wings in the air it was leant backwards and on both feet were two long ski’s. Over its yellowed beak, the bird wore a smile from ear to ear, and its left eye was closed. It seemed to laugh at Bart, his stomach lurched and felt unfriendly, he begun to weep.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">“What’s wrong Bart?”</p>
        <p>His mother said, appearing from behind the nest, hiding away a smile. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Nothing mother, just…”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Don’t you like it? I thought it was rather good, imagine that, a bird, one of us, skiing!”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Mmm-“</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“It’s quite amazing isn’t it… that birds from the north have learned such skills, they obviously know the townsfolk better than we do”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Yeah-yeah, it is…”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“What’s wrong?”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Nothing mama…”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Hmm. Hey, i’ve got something to cheer you up…Why can’t Penguin’s fly?”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Huh.. umm, I don’t kn- what’s a Penguin?”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“A snow-bird I think. Come on, Why can’t Penguin’s fly?!”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Umm, I don’t know mama”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Because they’re chocolate biscuits!” </p>
        <p class="dialogue">“What? What’s a chocolate biscuit?”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Oh Bart, I don’t know, it’s only a bit of fun! Our neighbours thought it was hilarious. It’s now on our wall, just go outside and have a look. I’m very proud of it.”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“But where’s Time Out mama? We’ve always had Time Out?”</p>
        <p class="dialogue">“It’s gone, I think it’s time for us all to move on, your father took it back to sea. Speaking of which, you’re in your second winter plumage, a lot of the other nesters are working the townsfolk circuit with their fathers. They’ve been bringing back all sorts of wonderful foods from the showrooms on the sea-shore. Tomorrow I would like you and your father to go down there. You are beautiful my son, and your far more likely to get food from the folks down there than your father.”</p>
        <p>Bart hesitated,</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">“Yes mama.”</p>
        <p>Bartholomew had never been to the seafront with his father. The other birds had said that the townsfolk dropped sticks of potato and brightly coloured sweet mud on the floor, which were good for sugar rushes. There was a rumour going round that if you put a young bird in the field on his own, he would come back with much more food than if an adult was present. The adults would perch on the surrounding roofs and make a hideout, whilst the young sons would chirp as high as they could until the townsfolk dropped something. Each adult kept eyes on their own, that was the rule. It was said that the ones who came back with the most had discovered that if you feigned disability, you would make the biggest catch. </p>
        <p>Barts father, tentative yet proud, zoned in on a middle aged town folk sitting on the pier. This one was quite slim, wearing un-smart clothing and staring at the ground between his feet. In his hands, he held some sort of speckled bread encased in nest material. Bart watched as the man’s pink gums came together over the two sides of the bread, macerating it quickly into a white and green slurry. He seemed quietly aware of Bart, who had now landed merely four steps away from him, appearing from behind a nearby bush, so as to not be seen flying. Bart approached, hobbling from left to right foot, and in a tired, almost bored expression, chirped. </p>
        <p>He chirped again, this time with more vigour, and caught the eye of his father on the rooftop, a determined and anxious look drawn on his brow. So perplexed he was, by his position, his pretence. Bart begun to stare through the man, imagining he wasn’t there, instead fixating on the dark space that he could not see behind him. He felt his feathers come apart and re-clamp in rhythmic motion, and his knees bent slightly each time the high rumble from his throat escaped. Chirping and chirping he found himself completely absent, and in his distraction he had missed the man flailing his hand rapidly towards Bart, stamping his feet on the stone below and yelling some kind of gibberish. “Chirp, Chiiirp, Chiiiiiiirp” Bart cried, from beneath the cold film he had over himself. </p>
        <p>At this point, Bart’s father flew down behind him and barked to the other nesters for backup. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">“OUAHHHH-AH AH AH AH AH AH AH AHH’</p>
        <p>In their hundreds they descended on the man, showering all manner of bottlecaps, stones and roof moss onto his head. In a rush of rage, the man begun to swing his arms and in the process launched the contents of his sandwich onto the floor, right in front of bart. A cold white sauce coated his feet and Bart was roused from his incessant and incontrollable chirping. At which point he saw the fathers and sons gluttonously picking at the contents, pushing and heaving in a whirling tessellation of outstretched wings. The man turned to face him, and found Barts face amongst the hubbub. From beneath a moustache, he mouthed a word that took Bart by immediate surprise, calming him considerably, but he had no idea what it meant. It was at this point that this man placed a hat on his head and Bart saw the living statue above which he perched. His heart sank.</p>
        <div class="poem">
          <p>Chirp, Chiirp, Chiiiiiiirp—The boys gone mad</p>
          <p>Squealing there for days,</p>
          <p>Made a hit on the sea-folk’s son,</p>
          <p>and discovered mayonnaise!</p>
        </div>
        <p>the nesters sang on the flyback. Bart was something of a hero; his incessant, rhythmic, impassioned chirping had earned him the badge of head crier. For years afterwards, Bart brought back all sorts of fine foods for the nesters: seared hake fillet, sticks of rock, triple-fried chips, crisps, once even a full tupperware of foil wrapped ham sandwiches. But his mind deteriorated rapidly, until he begun to not speak at all, unless he was crying on the sea front. Until his seventh and final year, when not crying, he would sit in front of his nest wall muttering “Time Out, Time Out, Time Out” under his breath, transfixed by the winking penguin. </p>
        <p>It was said that he had ventured behind the statue, to the place behind the light, where the head becomes detached from the body and the body from the voice: where words deny and swallow other words and rhythm and sing-song cease to exist. It was here that Bartholomew found the meaning of the word the sea-folks son had said to him, of which he would repeat for 7 years, in a language no nester would dare comprehend.</p>
        <div class="poem">
          <p>But now he’s ours, our talking head</p>
          <p>crying day by day,</p>
          <p>given a word from the sea-folks son,</p>
          <p>and now he’s lost his way.</p>
