    <meta name="description" content="The Idle Institute (est. 2017) is a storytelling lab: a collective of writers, filmmakers, sound-artists and engineers founded by Sonia Bernac and Eliot Allison. Combining theories of the public sphere with quantum physics, they investigate the potentialities of the story – seen as virtual matter and a precise political tool. This emerges from the presumption of an unstable narrative field, in which they examine unexpected couplings and clashes between narrative particles. The Idle Institute’s projects build from narrative experiments: poetic traps in urban space, phone pranks, impersonation games and sci-fi installations. Currently developing a theory of the narratology of the public sphere, their research explores narrative entanglement, machine(s) of writing and technologies of storytelling. They cheat occasionally, but only when it makes a good story…">

        <p>Old-Tom was a maker. A stern figure, cut-out by the habits of the post-war north, he went to work each day with his shoelaces tied in single knots—he had a stubborn confidence that he knew how to tie the best bootlace. His morning consisted of tasks beginning with ‘a’: a shave, a poo, a gurgle of Sandersons, a kiss, a bowl of something or other. These tasks accrued to shape his time of which he stuck to to utmost dedication, admittedly to the irritation of those close to him. Attired in blue, brown and a grey sweater beneath, he’d walk to the factory on Binns road with a set of chisels, a small tin of tobacco, Trebor extra strong mints, an austere packed lunch and denture cleaning solution—he had his teeth removed in his 20s, as most men did, forever shaping the destiny of his tea-browned gnashers. He’d smile at Hilde on the desk, who had just joined the company as they were expanding to the European market, staffing the desks with new employees addressed with definitive articles: 'the french', 'the belgians', the nice Italian lass' etc. Tom wasn’t much impressed with the tattle of the other workers, nor their compulsive infatuation with potential European romances; not to say he didn’t value the people of the mainland, their industriousness and expertise: he just didn’t like sex that much. </p>
        <p>Hilde, however, always had a soft-spot for old-Tom.  ‘What must it be like’ she’d think,  ‘He moves with the rhythm of the very machines he so meticulously fixes.’</p>
        <p>Some days she’d set out to find Greg on lunch hour and muse over a blowjob in the stock cupboard. She’d never intended to carry on having sex with Greg but it seemed to suit him, and she didn’t mind. Though her eyes used to burn at the backs, as the aimless lack of concentration would often end with her eyes fixed on the shelf marked ‘M6 tapping set’. Afterwards, as way of a thank you, Greg would allow Hilde to talk about Tom and project her work fetish onto the fast fading memory of what just happened. She’d hold Greg’s limp penis and examine and comment on where Tom would have shaven, because it would seem he cared about these things. Greg’s stomach would tighten and he would resolve never to return, as he didn’t exactly love Hilde but his carefully constructed demeanour of an experienced bachelor was beginning to break, and well, he wouldn’t mind getting married. It would after all make a lot of people happy. </p>
        <p>Of course Tom sensed this, but he utilised his insecurities productively for his work. Hilde would have to wait: he had a wife who wanted a house on the Wirral, a newborn baby and an ailing father to look after. The pressures of such circumstances lead to numerous heated conversations with the new factory manager Jacob, of whom Tom held in contemptuous respect. Jacob was an easy target, a man of provenance and privilege, unafraid of separating himself from his contemporaries. In this sense, Tom and Jacob were equitable. However, Jacob was unafraid of indicating his superiority through his good reason, that of being boss. Old Tom was always uncomfortable with this, he was happier remaining under the cover of his skill that could be verified by some authority, even posterity. ‘He lacks brass and lacks class’ Tom would say, emphasising the short vowels. </p>
        <p>The factory itself was a novel piece of early 20th Century engineering. Tom, who had taken his job as maintenance manager somewhat reluctantly, found many opportunities to fix the egg and dart coving in the ‘dinky toy’ showroom—hastening to defend himself on interrogation that 'the factory is just as much the machine as the machines themselves.’ The others looked on as Tom would meticulously rerun electricity wires under the floral carpets in the lobby, or repair the slow drips in the lavatories—they would catch his guarded eye in the mirror and glean condescending winks. They got into the habit of calling him ‘popping Tom’, for over the years he developed chronic hiccups: a result of the serious breath intake that he would hold when concentrating on repairs. </p>
        <p>Hilde, Greg, Jacob and the others held piteous respect for Tom, which served him just fine. It enabled him to operate under the lens of an idiot, which in turn gave him time for his true pleasures: fidgeting and whittling. On many occasions, they became one and the same thing, a simple job fitting a mortice lock may provide him the opportunity to whittle a small chess piece, or a set of toothpicks to offer at the new home they would one day have on the Wirral. Many of the machines needed joist support which overjoyed ‘popping Tom’, for each time this was the case, he would no doubt need to extract and replace noggins of elm or oak beam, in order to slot the new steel frame of the machine in place. He would sidle home without his ordinary moroseness on these days, and present them quietly around the dinner table to his wife, who would absent mindedly use them as a trivet for ‘Grandad’s’ boiled tripe ’n onions. Staring absently, he used to see the tripe climbing from the stew pot like an octopus. When kids were around, Grandad would pick up the tripe between ink-addled fingers and slip it down his throat with a gentle wobble. He’d stretch his tongue out to meet its milky dripping bottom and allow it to rest there, before sucking it down and clamping it with the full force of his jaw. Tom rarely noticed this, much to his father’s indifference. </p>
        <p>The thing was, all this blew over Tom. His visible periods of turmoil we’re expressed in a terse dialogue of tiny actions, often in the background of a social scene. In moments of blurring thoughts, Tom would begin to organise objects loudly on shelves and surfaces, until he felt he was being noticed by those nearby. He would let quick bursts of air come through his nostrils if annoyed but continually bat away any inquisition on the matter, making up an excuse about an unusual bout of winter hayfever. It was as if events didn’t penetrate him: words, actions, appraisals, books, tv - they just existed alongside him, not in him. For him, all menial phenomena held high entropy, in the sense that he didn’t see anything absurd about placing keys in the small hole beneath the coal bucket, for they fitted just right. Nor did he think it absurd to bring up bengal cat dung, during a tense conversation with an economically frail farming family—for he had overheard somewhere about the tritrichomonas foetus parasite, which could bring on endometritis in cattle. Such points were rarely given kindly under the cool cloak of reason; Tom manufactured everything, impregnating every event with his own unique design. </p>
        <p><hr/></p>
        <p>After being at the factory for just over 14 months, Hilde begun to tire of Tom’s indifference. Greg had long since given up on their casual relations and had sent himself into an emotional spiral so deep that he had pleaded with Jacob for a demotion to night-watchmen. Jacob had psychologically berated him so severely that over time, Greg’s confidence reached such a point where he was perfect for the job. Jacob saw this as an alternative method of helping Greg to where he really wanted to be. Hilde, tired- out by Greg’s emotional cesspit, fixated her fantasies on Tom. </p>
        <p>She begun with the clichés: unpopping her top dress button when he approached the desk and painting her nails a dark orange, so that they’d emphasise the dark tone of her newly tanned skin. She’d stare into the mirror, cross legged in her pyjamas and rehearse the first thing she’d say: 'you’ve been busy Tom... no, no! ...You look busy Tom?' </p>
        <p>As she rehearsed, she realised that Tom’s working mentality had penetrated her own: she was so dedicated to the idea of winning him that her competition had reached new and exhausting heights. The labour she already toiled in the office became a breeze in comparison to her rushing, fantastical mind. </p>
        <p></hr></p>
        <p>The day It came, she brushed a small amount of blusher onto her cheeks as she heard the clumsy crest of his chisel case hit the PVC window in the swivel door. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">‘Y-y-ou...y-you l-‘</p>
        <p class="dialogue">‘You okay Hilde?’ </p>
        <p class="dialogue">‘Yeah ...you lo-‘ </p>
        <p class="dialogue">‘-yeah fine ...Top button’s down love. Have a good day Hilde.’</p>
        <p>Staring through Hilde, he clicked-out then clicked-in his dentures in the ensuing silence, before dropping the pen of the sign-in-book back between the pages, then donned his hat and made his way towards the floor door. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">‘Buzz me in eh... Hilde?’ Hilde was speechless.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">‘Yea-‘</p>
        <p><hr class="onomato"></hr></p>
        <p>She’d buzzed before she realised she was doing it. She was losing control. Everything that worked didn’t work when he was around, and he was the mechanic. Somehow he always kept the order. </p>
        <p>Tom leant heavy on the door and in doing so, dropped his cap. As he bent down to pick it up he hit his head on the heavy door handle and knocked himself for six. The door was so heavy that as he lay there it pushed him towards the door frame to where he, a fleshy doorstop came to a standstill—face down, chisel set in hand, petrified like a horizontal man walking to work. </p>
        <p>Hilde looked down at her top button... then looked up. In the slowness that occupied those few seconds, she managed to register the orange blur of a post-van pass by outside, the crunch of a clocking card in the next room, the blister of her foot smudging the long fibres of the burgundy carpet. She became a photograph she’d seen before and longed to escape from... </p>
        <p>a moment now held in the hands of a moustached romantic, sipping port with friends and guffawing around the piano. Hilde’s mise-en-scene had been painted by the acclaimed artist ‘so and so’ and had received much publicity in the left wing press for its devoted portrayal of love in the lives of the working class. The artist had titled it ‘Hylas and the Nymph’, much to the gathering’s delectation. But as the laughter wained around the piano in the drunken slur, the guests eyes zoomed into the postcard once more and Hilde pushed her chair back, slowly. </p>
        <p>Standing, she felt the moistness between her thighs and felt embarrassed—she did not know why. She picked up the ticking desk clock next to her and pulled out the battery, placing it quietly on the desk, forever reading 08.34. She approached the extractor fan on the other side of the room, now roaring, and clicked down the cord to switch it off. She took off her peep-toe heels and pushed them side-by-side beneath the ridge of the chip board desk, before looking over to Tom. She approached him cautiously, pulled the chisel case from his hand, making sure that her skirt was pulled slack above her knees. She pushed the door gently, rolling the now stirring Tom with it, until he was on his back, then sat beside him. </p>

        <p class="dialogue">‘Wh-what-“hic”'</p>
        <p class="dialogue">'It’s okay Tom, you hit your head'</p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Ouuh' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'I know' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'What’s the day?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'It’s Valentine’s day Tom' </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">'No, I mean, what day of the week is it?'</p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Phhr, Wednesday' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Oh right ...post-day' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Yes Tom, post-day'</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">'That’s good ...I can’t feel my fingers love' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'What do you mean?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'They’re all numb' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'That’s because you hit your head Tom, they’ll come back' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'But I need them today, i’ve got to “hic-“ got to repair the skirting...'</p>
        <p class="dialogue">'hm...'</p>
        <p class="">Hilde had the strongest impulse to roll Tom back over and re-slam the door. He seemed to make a lot more sense as a company doorstop. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Just reach into my pocket love, i’ve got something for you'</p>
        <p class="dialogue">'For me?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue quote">'Yeah... just something'</p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Oh Tom, you... you...'</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">'It’s nothing to get excited about.' The impulse came back.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Okay'.</p>
        <p>She reached into the right pocket of his grey corduroy trousers and fixed her hand on something small, hard and wooden. It felt like a chess piece—warm and well sanded, moulded to the frame of her fingers. With difficulty, she clicked its base from the lip of his pocket, placed it carefully on her concave palm and squinted at it.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">'What’s that?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'It’s something I imagined the first day I saw you. Then it was in the draw at home, so I thought it’s best you have it.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'It is lovely Tom. Did you carve it?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'No.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Oh.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'But I did make one like it “hic” once.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Where is that one?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'My wife has it.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Oh... well, thank you I suppose...' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'It purrs you know.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Ookay... oh! Does it have a mechanism?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'No.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">‘...Then what do you mean?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'When you put it in the right place, it’s happy. It has needs, just like everything.'</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="dialogue">'But what is the right place?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'I don’t know, you’ll have to talk to it. It obviously liked my draw for a while, but when I cleaned last night, it told me it didn’t want to go to the Wirral.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Are you moving to the Wirral?' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'One day, just need my fingers to work first.' </p>
        <p class="dialogue">'Yes, I suppose so.' </p>
        <p>Tom gradually sat up and avoided precisely everything that should have happened. He kissed Hilde awkwardly on the cheek and invited her for dinner the following Thursday. He brushed off his top and apologised for the mess he’d left on the carpet, as his foil wrapped corned beef sandwich had been smudged by his heavy fall. He batted away the remnants off his trousers leg and promised Hilde to tidy up, just after he’d finished the skirting board. He closed the door and Hilde could just make out a muffled ‘FUCK’ from the other side. She of course couldn’t tell if this was in reference to the events at hand, or if he had just looked at his watch and realised he was behind schedule with the skirting repairs. </p>
        <p>She returned to her desk and placed It on a coaster to the right of the photograph of her father. It didn’t purr. She lifted it slightly and propped a post it note beneath it... still no purr. She stared at it blankly. </p>
        <p><hr class="star"></p>
        <p>The cat sat listlessly on the mat in the drawing room of the house where the guests drank and exchanged flirtatious glances in the periphery of the frame. It purred and felt around for the small ridge which it could dig its third toe on its polydactylic back paw into, to bed in that feeling of security that comes after something serendipitous. Unimpressed with the guests, and feeling the sense of security that comes with being dependent on those less intelligent than it, especially under the cover of a feline form, the cat conspired never to leave until the guests questioned 'what the hell has the cat ever done for us?' </p>
