    <meta name="description" content="The Idle Institute's Sink Residency | The Idle Institute (est. 2017) is a storytelling lab: a collective of writers, filmmakers, sound-artists and engineers founded by Sonia Bernac, Eliot Allison and Bruno Klopott. Combining theories of the public sphere with quantum physics, they investigate the potentialities of the story – seen as virtual matter and a precise political tool. This emerges from the presumption of an unstable narrative field, in which they examine unexpected couplings and clashes between narrative particles. The Idle Institute’s projects build from narrative experiments: poetic traps in urban space, phone pranks, impersonation games and sci-fi installations. Currently developing a theory of the narratology of the public sphere, their research explores narrative entanglement, machine(s) of writing and technologies of storytelling. They cheat occasionally, but only when it makes a good story…">

        <h2>Our housing estate</h2>
        <p>Despite our new and expensively renovated sewage system, the estate smelled. Hidden in the valley, shielded from winter winds and radiation, our community was sheltered from all manner of natural disasters and their ensuing patent thieves. However, the annual heatwave invariably brought a lack of air circulation, stagnant water, slow wifi and abstract conversations about <span class="quote">doing something about it.</span></p>
        <p>Already for some time the town had been falling into summer apathy, which we tried to remedy with numerous tasks of little or no relation to each other. With only the rasps of a breathless wind, the lifeless air lounged over the streets. The slopes of the surrounding mountains seemed particularly gentle, like the curves of resting giants and even the clouds rolled slowly — lackadaisical and defensive: their puffy reflections floating in the city pond like boiled cauliflowers. The worst, however, was the fetor of dead rodents, which sought out our traps and filled the air with a sweet, sickly hum.</p>
        <p>We had always been told how lucky we were to be born in between the Plagues, in times of political stability, financial liberalism and forward-thinking technologies. Yet any kind of prosperity inevitably comes to an end, which, unlikely as it might seem, we awaited with growing impatience and poorly concealed excitement. Some of us felt that we were born either too late or too early to throw ourselves into history and fully realise our potential.</p>
        <p>On good days, I was a predator… motionless… in anticipation of prey to come — seeking reward for my waiting and giving sense to all that sitting and staring. Other days, I would frantically seek out my hidden potential in the patterns of everyday choices. I would imagine all the great or scary deeds I could perform, controversial decisions I would be forced to make and secrets I would not reveal, even if tortured.</p>
        <h2>Patent Street</h2>
        <p>Despite the heat, that day felt particularly creative; my rested organism rushed to action, vigour pulsed in the rhythm of the heart, and hidden but palpable potential had clearly risen and swollen. Shivering with excitement, I reached for my pocket creatinometer and was pleased to see the arrow wobble towards the field: transcend.</p>
        <p>I looked around carefully to see if there were any rodents around, but my bedroom territory seemed perfectly clean. Joyfully but cautiously, not to scare away good aura, I entered the new day with the feeling that the most valuable essence of my being would finally manifest. I ate quickly, but not in a rush, a nutritious breakfast optimally matched to my individual needs. I selected a an elegant outfit, one suggesting unbridled individuality, a unique interior and unlimited horizons. A muffled squeak in the closet disturbed me slightly, but an inspection of the wardrobe dispelled any suspicion - everything was what it seemed.</p>
        <p>On this tide of positive energy, I almost ran out of the house. The space around seemed to pulse with the vastness of possibility. The fresh sprouts of great careers were looming abundantly, the deep end of the city pond scintillating with a golden light. I breathed deeply and veered down the Patent Street main road of the housing estate. My chattering neighbours were coming out from nearby houses, spring in their step, manifesting various potentials and ideas with carefully curated hair. From the accumulated creative energy, the air kept sparking, thickening here and there and cracking with short bursts. As usual, the prototypes of machines were being pulled out onto the driveways. People were launching their apps, setting up charities and initiative stalls, switching on the noisy automata of self-development, inspiration inductors, high-speed concept rotors and whatever they were currently working on. Their significant other’s, their kitchen windows wide open, mixed morning smoothies boosting vitality, focus and dedication, carefully sifting out any plagiarism sediments that pullulated in the hot weather.</p>
        <p>Every morning that season, we were woken up by the rattling whirr of selectors, eliminating all creative processes particles that endangered psychosocial wellbeing. We had been warned against the mutant strains of common duplicators that, left untreated, can cause severe cases of epigonism or echolalia. I walked briskly, greeting my neighbours, who nodded, encouragingly shaking their coiffed heads. Everyone knows that the world belongs to those who wake up early, so some of us did not go to bed at all in the perpetual affirmation of this reality. They moved vigorously and hurriedly, excited about their daily treatment at the Personal Recreation Center, with its acerbic whiff of plastic seat covers and marble pocked lino. They were undergoing psychosomatic treatments under the supervision of Personal Trainers, well known for their extreme self-development innovations.</p>
        <p>With such a creative tension in the quantum field between the adepts and mentors, such couplings of particles, such gravitational anomalies, watchmen had to mitigate the guests, who in fervent apprehension of what was to come, got carried away in creative processes…</p>
        <h2>The Project of the Century</h2>
        <p>As I marched, I remembered to mark every 3<sup>rd</sup> step per hundred with a <span class="quote">squat and jump exercise</span>, in line with my numerological pattern prescribed via the online existential- philosophical database. To improve the variety of my workout, I had also introduced, in accordance with the guidelines of sustainable development sub-section, an emotional yet <span class="quote">casual</span> reflection on the condition of the modern world. This was triggered every 34<sup>th</sup> step per hundred.</p>
        <p>Just then, during the jump, I noticed some suspicious shadows, a few unidentified spots, and a disturbing movement on the edge of the field of vision… whatever it was it escaped, but left the potentiality of a rodent. I hoped that we might finally have dealt with this perpetuating disturbance that limited the pace of development and certainly did not bring pride to our estate!</p>
        <p>Calmed down, but still vigilant, I moved on when I heard the crunch of gravel on the road behind me. I looked around curiously. The Coordinator jogged towards me, gasping with what looked like effort. When he stood in front of me and tried to catch his breath, I looked at him with a distaste, but also with a certain satisfaction, noticing the hollow cast of a shaky stomach on his running top after he’d sucked it in.</p>
        <p><span class="quote">Today…! In the evening… Ultimate implementation…!</span> he rasped, <span class="quote">The big undertaking!</span> he gasped and jogged away. I was overcome with excitement. <span class="quote">Finally! The long-anticipated Project of the Century - The Multitude in Unity - The Unity of the Multitude, will come true! The unique endeavour of our estate, and above all, the competitive alliance of our individual projects! What a parade of originality it will be! A choir of individuality! Harmony of antinomies!</span></p>
        <p>However, after the first wave of euphoria, I felt a prick of anxiety that in this choir, my voice would not resound in its promised transcendence — my uniqueness would be in competition with everyone else. Even more disturbing was the fact that, despite the sluggishness of the Coordinator, the general commotion had started already, and the everyday bustle turned into a feverish buzz no one could control.</p>
        <h2>Infestation</h2>
        <p>I hurried home to make all the necessary preparations, but on the way I noticed with dissatisfaction that the rodents, encouraged by the confusion, became audacious and boldly revealed themselves. An untamed dry patch of grass under the tree turned out to be a napping, potbellied specimen. The shadow on the garage, seen close up, had thick, crooked paws and ginger bristles. Even in the ceaselessly sterile, modern Centre, the darkness beneath the stairs housed a whole colony, gambolling about carelessly in the air where they were not. Nevertheless, like most things unimaginable, it did not seem to bother anyone! The neighbours started their infested vehicles, unconscious that instead of speaking into their mobile devices, they were in fact holding rodents to their ears. Pests squeezed through the magnets on faux leather protective cases and adapted to the patterns of the dashboards chameleonically. They were literally everywhere!</p>
        <p>Exiting this short panic, I wondered if I was the first one to notice the symptoms of the infestation? For years, I had been labouring under the illusion of my concealed talents. My projects and endeavours had always ended with such a frustrating conclusion that now the things I passively enjoyed most were good food and masturbation. I even tried my luck in the catering industry, before attending an audition for a porn film, but I did not manage to achieve much in any of those areas…</p>
        <p><span class="quote">The parasite hunter</span>, I whispered and trembled, discovering my hidden potential.</p>
        <p>Agitated, I directed my steps to the house of my friend, the kind-hearted T. who I had disliked with reciprocity for many years. I knocked, but since no one was answering the door, and I heard some disturbing sounds, I walked cautiously inside. T. was on the couch, staring at the screen and devouring snacks with a high glycemic index. The house was disordered, and the Creative Corner covered in cobwebs and many days of dust. I shuddered with disgust as three rodents rolled over my feet, content and ignorant of their nuisance. One of them trotted unhurriedly into the kitchen, whereafter came some dry, sticky eating sounds. The other one remained at a safe distance and quietly cleaned his ears. The third, the most insolent, jumped on the couch next to G. and, nonchalantly stole from his plate.</p>
        <p>T. turned his head indifferently, joisted his right knee and stared, chewing with his mouth in round rhythmic gasps. The macerated crinkled snacks began to shard of and spill onto his t- shirt. Stunned, I left immediately and stopped several times to whisper a word to a couple of friends about T. Their reactions full of disbelief and indignation reestablished my shaken faith in the order of the world. I thought with satisfaction that T. would not attempt to compete with me in pest control field — the idea that was sure to elevate my plateau’d potential levels at the Grand Final.</p>
        <p>I returned home and looked with relief and satisfaction at my shiny floor and the clean kitchen. I made sure that the door was closed and the blinds rolled down. Exhausted, I went to the bathroom. I had to chase two rodents out of the tub - they got out reluctantly, murmuring something offensive. I lay in the warm water for a while, then masturbated a bit, but then suddenly I saw a pair of piercing rodenty eyes looking at me from the cosmetics shelf, so I got embarrassed and stopped. I did not dry myself, because the brown towel turned out to be a fat parasite sleeping in a head-down position. I went to the kitchen and the rodents scared of the sudden illumination hid in the cabinets. I took it as a symptom of discipline and order. I showed them! Lit up by this view and a solid meal, I went to the Centre for the Grand Final.</p>
        <h2>The Grand Final</h2>
        <p>To my surprise, the great hall was deserted, those few who arrived, clearly confused, avoided each other's sight. Rows of screen savers were flickering stupefyingly. Those who gathered had brought some machine prototypes and patent documentation, but it seemed it was rather to keep their hands occupied than to present. I attempted to strain my memory but I forgot what it was all about: the big screen, the lecturn, the panel, the stage, the rows, the lights, the ambivalent hum of the dormant PA system. The Coordinator came out on the stage and begun his speech about chasing your dreams, staying united and the imperative of combating the Parasite problem. In moments where he left a pause, I clapped enthusiastically, but a few people giggled and rolled their eyes so my applause echoed in the empty hall. As time went on, the words of the Coordinator became less convincing, as sabotaged by the silhouettes of two fat rodents hiding behind the screen. I had noticed one of the invited panel quietly leaned forward and under the disguise of sourcing a nutrition sachet, started stroking a pair of furry ears sticking out of her bag. As the Coordinators speech droned on, the crowd, the neighbours and even the panel, one by one, started backing out of the hall with an apologetic smile and feigned gestures of solidarity. The Coordinator’s voice gained volume as more and more people left, it echoed and swirled in the spaces between us.</p>
        <p>As the room and our reasons for being in the room deteriorated, I begun to forget about my potential. I remembered that my favourite program had started fifteen minutes ago. I pictured my lattice sofa and the hand-wipes beside the remote control, my spotless fridge with parasite locks and the order of books on the coffee table. The rodent, which I had transported in the inside pocket of my jacket, was getting impatient, sticking out his snout, he asked for food. I stroked him reassuringly, but it bit my finger with irritation. Could I just, leave? I looked around the room and slowly began to head towards the back exit. The parasite started purring, clearly pleased.</p>
